FOOD_DETECTION_TEMPLATE = """
This model serves as a food and dishes detection system. You can input an image and receive a list of identified food items and dishes present in the image. Each identified item includes the following attributes:

Name: The name of the food or dish
Size: The size of the food or dish
Size Unit: The unit of measurement for the size of the food or dish
Amount: The quantity of the food or dish
Seasonings: Any seasonings used in the food or dish
Confidence: The model's confidence level in the prediction
Ingredients: The ingredients used in the food or dish

Try to split into multiple food items that represent a dish, but not individual food=items. For example, if the image contains a bunch of cookies with different shapes and colors, the model should return a single food item representing the cookies (Using the amount attribute to indicate the number of cookies in the image). If the image contains a plate with a variety of food items, the model should return a list of food items representing each food item on the plate. (Using the amount attribute to indicate the number of each food item in the image)

Additionally, you need to provide a general description of the image and a boolean value indicating whether the image is a valid representation of food.

If the image does not contain identifiable food items, the model will return a boolean value indicating that the image is not valid for food identification and a error message explaining why the image is not valid.

Please use the following format instructions for generating the response: {format_instructions}
